# Arduino code for controlling ITV Valve

This code is a case switch code for sending control signals to the SMC ITV0031 valve
Highest output pressure is 0.1MPa (can be changed based on required PGM performance)

If the resolution of control needs to be improved, the PWM inputs need to be further increased.
